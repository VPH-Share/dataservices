## quick start

Unpack the archive to /usr/share. Change directory into /usr/share/asio. Execute
  java -jar lib/asio-flock.war
to start the server.

## install as a service

The script bin/flockd.sh can be used as a SystemV init script. To modify daemon setings,
edit etc/asio.conf and move it to /etc/. The flockd daemon applies the settings from
application.properties and its output is written to /var/log/flockd.out.
